# Test Case Prioritization Using Test Distances

This project includes a small experiment which compares different Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques. TCP techniques aim to re-order test cases within the regression test suite in order to maximize desirable properties (i.e., early fault detection).
 
The project is implemented in Groovy and Java. So if you would like to run the experiment, you need to have both JDK and Groovy SDK in your system.
The experiment uses a small dataset (27 revisions of Joda-Time project) which is included in the project.
