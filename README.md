# Test Case Prioritization Using Test Distances

This project includes a small experiment which compares different Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques using test distances (inverse similarity). TCP techniques aim to re-order test cases within the regression test suite in order to maximize early fault detection.
 
The experiment uses a small dataset (27 revisions of Joda-Time project) which is included in the project.
